This piece is one of my favorites. Featuring a rose frozen in a chunk of ice, this magical piece is paired with a composition I wrote many years ago. The composition originally titled, 'Cirques des RÃªves' was written during the holidays in 2017 after reading the book, 'The Night Circus'. It has a special place in my heart and I'm glad I found a purpose for this piece.
